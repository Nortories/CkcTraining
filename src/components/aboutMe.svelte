  <p>
    I'm Chantel Clark, I am in my 20'tys, and I've harbored an
    entrepreneurial spirit since a young age. My passion for working with people
    and their dogs stems from my upbringing. Growing up, I had a little white
    family dog whom I dearly wanted to take everywhere. However, his unruly
    behavior—barking, lunging, and pulling uncontrollably—made it impossible.
    Every outing turned into a stressful ordeal. This frustration sparked my
    journey into dog training. I yearned to provide the freedom and relief I
    craved to clients, enabling them to enjoy every moment with their beloved
    companions.
    <br /><br />
    For the past four years, I've dedicated myself to this mission, and I've never
    looked back. Continuously striving for improvement, I seek to expand my expertise
    and enhance my intellectual property. Beyond my work, I cherish spending time
    outdoors with my animals, family, and friends. Staying active in sports complements
    my active lifestyle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I'm pursuing my bachelor's degree in Business Marketing at SUU,
    now in my third year. Despite my academic pursuits, dog training remains my
    full-time passion. Based in Southern Utah, I'm deeply embedded in the local
    dog community. My journey in dog training has been shaped by years of
    hands-on experience, invaluable mentorship, and self-taught expertise.
    <br /><br />
    I invite potential clients to explore my work on social media, validating my
    capabilities firsthand. My genuine passion for dog training drives me to deliver
    exceptional results, bringing joy and harmony to the lives of both clients and
    their furry companions.
